# CheapestRouteFinder

An app that assists users in finding the cheapest routes between destinations

## Prerequisites

Swift 5.9

XCode 15.0.1 (15A507)

## Achieved

Completed all 5 requirements (along with BONUS one) and followed all the instructions

Used TDD, Protocol - oriented programming and separations of concerns

Added logical checks before calculating route: Are cities set and not empty, are cities different and not the same

Handled loading and error states of the app

Anticipated and implemented L10N logic

## Possible improvements

General UI/UX. Especially autocomplete list view

Need to add support for different JSON models. As for now only supports JSON from the URL from test assignment.

Performance improvement of offloading cheapest route calculation from the main thread (not needed for small number of Connections like in the test url)
